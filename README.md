Allmighty Bot
====================================

### What is it?

Allmighty Bot is a bot used by me in my Twitch channel. Could probably also be used as a general IRC bot.

### Coding Standards

+ Please keep all line lengths to 120 characters and use 4 spaces rather than tab characters
+ Please keep all variables at the top of the class
+ Please keep all inner classes at the bottom
+ Please don't use star imports
+ Please use the IntelliJ-Coding-Style.xml for the project (if using IntelliJ) in order to keep all formatting consistent
+ Please don't do large commits. My preference is a single commit for a single fix/addition rather than bundled up commits

### Usage

Simply run 'mvn clean install' to get executable jar files in the target/ folder and run it.
